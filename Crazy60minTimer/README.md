# Crazy Wall Clock

A modified wall clock that makes time pass in a crazy way.
Out of 5 min, the first 3 minutes the "seconds" pass slower (every 2 seconds) and the next 2 min, seconds pass realy fast (every half second). On average you still get a +/- 2 min real time.

Realy good clock for waiting rooms :)
